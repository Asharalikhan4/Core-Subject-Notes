# What is Data and Database?
**Data -** Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.

Word 'Data' is originated from the word 'datum' that means 'single piece of information.' It is plural of the word datum.

In computing, Data is information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing. Data is interchangeable.

**Database -** A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.

Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.

The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.

There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.

There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).

SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.

A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.

# What is DBMS ( Database Management System ) with example?
Database Management System (DBMS) is software for storing and retrieving user's data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs that manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software store and retrieve data. DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirements. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application. Some popular example are MySql, Oracle, dBASE, MariaDB, IBM DB2 etc.

# Why do we need DBMS?
A Data Base Management System is a system software for easy, efficient and reliable data processing and management. It can be used for Creation of a database, Retrieval of information from the database, Updating the database, Managing a database, Multiple User Interface, Data scalability, expandability and flexibility.
Overall the time for developing an application is reduced with the help of the DBMS. Some most common use of DBMS are listed below -
1. Data Organization and Management
2. Data Security and Privacy
3. Data Integrity and Consistency
4. Concurrent Data Access
5. Data Analysis and Reporting
6. Scalability and Flexibility
7. Cost-Effectiveness

# What is Database Admin and it's fuction?
A Database Administrator (DBA) is an individual or person responsible for controlling, maintaining, coordinating, and operating a database management system. Managing, securing, and taking care of the database systems is a prime responsibility. They are responsible and in charge of authorizing access to the database, coordinating, capacity, planning, installation, and monitoring uses, and acquiring and gathering software and hardware resources as and when needed. Their role also varies from configuration, database design, migration, security, troubleshooting, backup, and data recovery. Database administration is a major and key function in any firm or organization that is relying on one or more databases.
Role and Duties of Database Administrator (DBA) :
1. Decides hardware – 
They decide on economical hardware, based on cost, performance, and efficiency of hardware, and best suits the organization. It is hardware that is an interface between end users and the database.
2. Manages data integrity and security – 
Data integrity needs to be checked and managed accurately as it protects and restricts data from unauthorized use. DBA eyes on relationships within data to maintain data integrity.
3. Database Accessibility –  
Database Administrator is solely responsible for giving permission to access data available in the database. It also makes sure who has the right to change the content.
4. Database design – 
DBA is held responsible and accountable for logical, physical design, external model design, and integrity and security control.
5. Database implementation – 
DBA implements DBMS and checks database loading at the time of its implementation.
6. Query processing performance – 
DBA enhances query processing by improving speed, performance, and accuracy.
7. Tuning Database Performance – 
If the user is not able to get data speedily and accurately then it may lose organization’s business. So by tuning SQL commands DBA can enhance the performance of the database.
