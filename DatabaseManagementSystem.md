# What is Data and Database?
**Data -** Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.

Word 'Data' is originated from the word 'datum' that means 'single piece of information.' It is plural of the word datum.

In computing, Data is information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing. Data is interchangeable.

**Database -** A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.

Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.

The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.

There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.

There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).

SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.

A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.

# What is DBMS ( Database Management System ) with example?
Database Management System (DBMS) is software for storing and retrieving user's data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs that manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software store and retrieve data. DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirements. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application. Some popular example are MySql, Oracle, dBASE, MariaDB, IBM DB2 etc.

# Why do we need DBMS?
A Data Base Management System is a system software for easy, efficient and reliable data processing and management. It can be used for Creation of a database, Retrieval of information from the database, Updating the database, Managing a database, Multiple User Interface, Data scalability, expandability and flexibility.
Overall the time for developing an application is reduced with the help of the DBMS. Some most common use of DBMS are listed below -
1.Data Organization and Management
2.Data Security and Privacy
3.Data Integrity and Consistency
4.Concurrent Data Access
5.Data Analysis and Reporting
6.Scalability and Flexibility
7.Cost-Effectiveness
